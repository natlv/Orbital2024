# GreenSG

Hi there! Our project is titled GreenSG, and our project level is Apollo 11.  

Project objectives: 
- Create a web application using Django on the backend in order to reward and encourage sustainable behaviors

Resources:
- Web team (two people), 11 hours of work a week for 13 weeks

Deliverables:
- Showcase formulated project idea and technical proof of concept by June 3
- Showcase minimally prototype (A1 multi-panel poster, 5 minute video) by July 1
- Entire functional website by end-July 2024

Project roadmap and timeline:
- March 15: Project proposal
- May 20: Project poster and pitch video
- June 3: Milestone 1 (features identified, development plan created, technical proof of concept)
- July 1: Milestone 2 (prototype with essential features, system testing performed)
- 29 July: Milestone 3 (further system and user testing performed, extension of system with more useful features)

Our proposed core features are:
- a platform for users to create and sign up for sustainability-related events
- a Challenges and Rewards system where users can earn points by taking part in sustainable activities and then exchange these points for rewards
- a Sustainable Service Listings and Product Marketplace.

In addition, we proposed to include the following additional features:
- a Sustainability Tip of the Day
- Educational resources
- Additional reward-earning tasks.

Our user stories are as follows:
- As a local community member who wants to be more involved in green events such as tree-planting, environmental clean-ups, and workshops, I want to be able to find events and sign up for them using the app. It would be great if I could filter by location, duration, and event type as well.
- As a local community member who wants to learn how to apply sustainability in my own daily life, learn from others, and possibly share my own experiences, I want to be able to receive sustainability tips, read up on current trends and discoveries, and have a platform where I can post sustainability related content.
- As a sustainable product purchaser who wants to find sustainable goods and services, I want to be able to seamlessly connect with sellers and service providers. These could include eco-friendly cleaning services, zero-waste grocery stores, and repair cafés.
- As a sustainable product provider who wants to increase exposure to my products, I want to be able to market to a wider audience through this online platform.
- As a user who wants to receive rewards for purchasing green alternatives, I want to be able to complete tasks, gain points, and claim rewards within the app. This would likely require partnerships with sustainable brands and merchants (for purchasing sustainable alternative goods). Taking part in sustainability events would add points. We may also include tasks like recycling, although this would require some method of verification to prove the user actually completed the task.

Inspired by Singapore’s Green Plan 2030, we hope to expedite sustainable living habits and mindset among the Singaporean population. 
Drawing from existing ideas that have had success locally, including Carousell’s product marketplace and Healthy 365’s unique rewards system, 
we hope to combine useful features and more in our sustainability-oriented app, GreenSG. 
We hope to help Singaporeans make the transition to a sustainable lifestyle, and in their journey towards a greener Singapore and positive environmental change,
through a multi-pronged approach that leverages technology and community engagement to inspire a culture of sustainability.
